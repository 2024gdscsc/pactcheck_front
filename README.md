# Pactcheck

Pactcheck is a product that can review all the contract terms easily and store it safely.

The existing power imbalances, lack of accessible legal resources, and unjust system are all contributing to the problem.
The lack of accessible legal resources is making it difficult for businesses to challenge unfair terms and conditions.
The unjust system is leading to exploitative terms and unequal outcomes for businesses.
These problems are having a negative impact on businesses, making it difficult for them to compete and succeed.

Our service allows users to check the legal statements in their contract before they sign on it, preventing the problems due to the unfair contract terms.
